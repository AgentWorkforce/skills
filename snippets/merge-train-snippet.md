## Merging: `trunk` + the `mergeable` label

CI does **not** run on feature branches. It runs only on the `trunk` → `main`
pull request and on pushes to `main`. (Repos whose default branch is not
`main`, e.g. `master`, use that branch wherever this says `main`.) A merge
agent batches ready PRs into `trunk`, gets that one PR green, and merges it.

**When you open a PR**
1. Branch from `trunk` and open the PR with **base `trunk`**, not `main`.
   A PR into `main` from any other branch fails the `Trunk guard` check.
2. No CI runs on your PR, so verify locally before calling it ready: run the
   typecheck, tests and lint this repo uses, and list the exact commands and
   results in the PR body.

**When the PR is ready**
3. Add the label **`mergeable`** once all of these are true:
   - The change is complete and the local checks above pass.
   - Review feedback (human and bot) is addressed or answered.
   - It is not a draft and does not depend on an unmerged PR.
4. Remove `mergeable` if the PR stops being ready (new work, a failing check, a
   blocking question). The label is read live from GitHub on every sweep.

**What you must not do**
- Do not merge your own PR, and never merge into or push to `trunk` or `main`
  directly.
- Do not re-enable CI for feature branches or edit the `trunk` gates in
  `.github/workflows/`.

**The merge agent** sweeps open `mergeable` PRs with base `trunk` about every
10 minutes. It reads each PR's linked sessions (the `Agent Relay sessions`
block in the PR body, then the session summary) for context, merges them into
`trunk`, opens or updates the `trunk` → `main` PR, fixes CI there, merges when
green, and posts a summary. If your PR conflicts with `trunk`, it may ask you
to rebase on `trunk`; do so and keep the label.

> Interim: the sweep worker is not deployed yet. Until it is, a human or a
> designated agent performs the merge-agent steps manually. Labelling is unchanged.
