/**
 * pr-reviewer handler — review, auto-fix, and shepherd a PR to the finish line.
 *
 *   an authorized approval (pull_request_review.submitted) → merge the PR.
 *   a check run that finished green (check_run.completed)   → nothing to do.
 *   anything else — opened, new commits (synchronize), a
 *   review comment, failed CI, changes requested            → (re)review and fix.
 *
 * The PR's repo is materialized into ctx.sandbox.cwd by cloud before the
 * harness runs. The agent fixes by editing files there; cloud commits and
 * pushes those edits after the harness exits — no git/gh in the harness.
 *
 * Slack policy: the channel only hears about a PR when it's a human's turn —
 * checks green, every bot/reviewer comment resolved, nothing left for the agent
 * to fix (the agent's READY sentinel). In-progress passes stay silent. The only
 * other pings are operator/terminal signals: a failed harness run and a merge.
