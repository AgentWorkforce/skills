# Creating Cloud Persona

Use this skill when authoring a deployable Workforce persona in the **current** shape.

## Core rule

A cloud persona is two files that ship **as a pair**:

1. `persona.ts` (`definePersona({...})`) declares **deployment metadata and runtime wiring**, and points at the handler via `onEvent: './agent.ts'`. It compiles to `persona.json` (a generated, gitignored artifact — author `persona.ts`, never the compiled JSON).
2. `agent.ts` (`export default defineAgent({...})`) implements the **actual behavior**.

**Always ship both.** The runtime's composable-runtime closure treats `persona.ts`
as the canonical entry; a bare `agent.ts` with no sibling `persona.ts` falls back
to a **synthesized minimal-preview persona** (and emits a compatibility warning) —
you lose the real harness/model/integration/memory wiring. (The
`composable-runtime-closure` acceptance harness in the agents repo pins this: it
fails if a deploy synthesizes a persona instead of loading `persona.ts`.)

Important: **triggers, schedules, and watch rules are declared in `agent.ts` via `defineAgent(...)`, while `persona.ts` declares deploy/runtime config and integration connection requirements.**
The handler branches on `event.type` (a provider-prefixed dotted string like
`slack.message.created`, `linear.issue.create`, or `cron.tick`) and reads the
payload via `await event.expand('full')`. **See "Event model (v4)" below — the
pre-v4 `event.source` / `event.payload` / `event.name` shape is GONE in
runtime ≥ 4, and most of the inline examples further down still use it.**

## First read

Before authoring, read the vendored examples and current types in this skill's
`references/` directory. They are copied from the current Workforce and agents
repos so the skill is self-contained.

Production agents — each is a **`persona.ts` + `agent.ts` pair**. `persona.ts` is
the **authored source** (edit it, never the JSON). Each reference dir also carries
a `persona.json` — the **compiled artifact** (`agentworkforce persona compile
<dir>/persona.ts`, persona-kit 4.1.23) — vendored so you can see the shipped shape;
in the live agents repo that file is gitignored (`*/persona.json`) and regenerated
on demand:

- `references/agents/review/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — PR reviewer: harness run + VFS github reads, per-PR Slack thread, merge, `capabilities.conflictResolve`
- `references/agents/repo-hygiene/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — sandboxed shell + Notion writeback via VFS `writeJsonFile`/`draftFile`
- `references/agents/linear/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — Linear Agent Session API (`linearClient().agentActivity/respond/acknowledge`) + thin-lead `ctx.workflow.run` delegation
- `references/agents/linear-slack/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — harness-emits-fenced-actions rail, receipt-gated Linear writes
- `references/agents/hn-monitor/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — `@agentworkforce/delivery` multi-transport, threaded digest, two-tier `ctx.memory` + `ctx.files` state
- `references/agents/joke-bot/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — `sandbox: false` conversational bot, triple transport, `capabilities.conversational`
- `references/agents/inbox-buddy/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — `sandbox: true` **required** for VFS Gmail reads, dual-transport, cross-turn memory
- `references/agents/gcp-watcher/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — token-free VFS monitor, dedup by signature, pure exported `evaluateSignals`
- `references/agents/cloud-team-implementer/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` and `references/agents/cloud-team-reviewer/{persona.ts,agent.ts}` — team members (`launchedBy: 'team-dispatcher'`)

- `references/workforce/packages/cli/src/deploy-command.ts`
- `references/relayfile-adapters/packages/relay-helpers/README.md`

## Current persona shape to follow

Prefer the **actual shipped shape**, not older plan text.

For cloud personas, expect fields like:

- `id`
- `intent`
- `tags`
- `description`
- `cloud: true`
- `useSubscription` (optional)
- `integrations` (optional, for provider connection requirements, mount scope, and adapter config passthrough — see Authoring rules 3 and 4)
- `memory` (optional; production agents use both `true` and object form)
- `onEvent`
- top-level runtime fields, when the agent uses a harness:
  - `harness`
  - `model`
  - `systemPrompt`
  - `harnessSettings`
- optional `inputs`, `env`, `sandbox`, `skills`, `permissions`, `mount`, `mcpServers`, `capabilities`, `relay`

Do **not** author older `tiers` / `defaultTier` structures unless the repo explicitly still uses them. The latest Workforce examples use flat top-level runtime fields.

## Mental model

### `persona.json` does

- declares whether the persona is deployable
- chooses the harness/model/runtime knobs
- declares which integrations must be connected
- enables memory
- points at the handler entrypoint
- optionally declares capabilities/metadata

### `agent.ts` does

- exports `defineAgent({...})`
- declares `triggers`, `schedules`, and optionally `watch`; team-member agents
  can intentionally declare none and use `launchedBy: 'team-dispatcher'`
- receives `ctx` and `event` in `handler`
- branches on `event.type` (provider-prefixed dotted string, or `cron.tick`)
- reads the payload via `await event.expand('full')` (see "Event model (v4)")
- reads and writes provider data through **`@relayfile/relay-helpers`** clients (`linearClient().comment(...)`, `slackClient().post(...)`, `githubClient().mergePullRequest(...)`, or the generic `relayClient(provider)` / `providerClient(provider)`) — catalog-backed, no hardcoded paths. The raw `@agentworkforce/runtime` VFS helpers (`readJsonFile` / `writeJsonFile`) stay the lower-level fallback. There are **no** per-provider clients on `ctx` (no `ctx.github` / `ctx.linear`)
- optionally calls `ctx.harness.run(...)`
- optionally calls `ctx.llm.complete(...)` for smaller synthesis
- optionally delegates to `ctx.workflow.run(...)`
- optionally uses `ctx.files.*` or `ctx.sandbox.*`
- optionally uses `ctx.memory.*`
- performs the actual workflow

## Trigger model

Cloud agents currently have four practical shapes, and wakeups are authored in
`agent.ts`:

1. **Clock** via `defineAgent({ schedules: [...] })`
   - branch on `event.type === 'cron.tick'`
   - the cron event carries `event.schedule` (the cron expr / one-shot id) and
     `event.scheduledFor` — there is **no** `event.name`. For a single-schedule
     persona, treat any `cron.tick` as that schedule (see gotcha §G2).

2. **Radio** via `defineAgent({ triggers: { <provider>: [...] } })`
   - the event's `type` is the **provider-prefixed** `on` value: a trigger
     `{ slack: [{ on: 'message.created' }] }` delivers `event.type ===
     'slack.message.created'`
   - branch with `event.type === '<provider>.<on>'` (or
     `event.type.startsWith('<provider>.')` for a whole provider)
   - a trigger can carry `paths: ['/slack/channels/${SLACK_CHANNEL}/**']` to
     **scope wake-routing before provisioning** (and `match: '@mention'` /
     `where: 'field=value'` to gate further — see §2 wake-cost). The `${INPUT}`
     token is **deploy-time input-ref substitution inside a single-quoted
     string** (resolved from the persona input at deploy), **not** JS template
     interpolation — write it literally, don't backtick-interpolate it.
   - provider names in triggers are **canonicalized at deploy** via known
     aliases (e.g. `google-mail` → `gmail`), so an alias in a trigger still
     matches its integration; keep the `integrations` key in the form the
     adapter documents.

3. **Relayfile watch** via `defineAgent({ watch: [...] })`
   - for file/path-driven proactive behavior
   - keep this for cases that are truly about Relayfile path changes, not provider event hooks

4. **Team member** via `defineAgent({ launchedBy: 'team-dispatcher', handler })`
   - no direct triggers/schedules/watch
   - launched by a lead/team dispatcher to avoid duplicate subscriptions
   - see `references/agents/cloud-team-implementer/agent.ts` and
     `references/agents/cloud-team-reviewer/agent.ts`

`persona.json.integrations` still matters, but for **connection/setup**, not for declaring which events fire the handler.

## Event model (v4) — verified against workforce 4.1.34 (agents repo pins runtime/persona-kit 4.1.23)

The handler `event` is the relay SDK's normalized `AgentEvent`
(`@agent-relay/events`), narrowed by `defineAgent` to the triggers/schedules you
declared. **The pre-v4 `{ source, payload, workspaceId }` shape — and
`WorkforceProviderEvent` / `WorkforceCronEvent` — were removed.** Authoring
against them fails to typecheck (`has no exported member 'WorkforceProviderEvent'`,
`Property 'source' does not exist`). Many examples below still show the old shape;
prefer this section.

- **Discriminant is `event.type`** — a dotted, provider-prefixed string:
  `cron.tick`, `slack.message.created`, `linear.issue.create`,
  `github.pull_request.opened`. There is no `event.source`.
- **Payload is async**: `const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;` — not a
  synchronous `event.payload`. `event.resource` is the resource handle;
  `event.id` / `event.workspace` / `event.occurredAt` still exist.
- **Cron**: `event.type === 'cron.tick'`; the fired schedule is `event.schedule`
  (cron expr / one-shot id) + `event.scheduledFor`. **No `event.name`.**
- **Import** `WorkforceEvent` (alias of `AgentEvent`) for helper signatures;
  don't import the removed `WorkforceProviderEvent`.

Canonical v4 handler:

```ts
import { defineAgent, type WorkforceCtx, type WorkforceEvent } from '@agentworkforce/runtime';

export default defineAgent({
  schedules: [{ name: 'daily', cron: '0 9 * * 1-5' }],
  triggers: { github: [{ on: 'pull_request.opened' }], slack: [{ on: 'message.created', match: '@mention' }] },
  handler: async (ctx, event) => {
    if (event.type === 'cron.tick') return runDaily(ctx);            // single schedule → no name gate
    if (event.type === 'github.pull_request.opened') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;               // payload is async
      return reviewPr(ctx, data);
    }
    if (event.type === 'slack.message.created') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;
      return replyMention(ctx, data);
    }
  }
});
```

Exhaustiveness note: when your declared triggers/schedules narrow `event` to a
closed union and you handle every case, a trailing `event.type` access is `never`
and won't typecheck — drop the unreachable fallback rather than casting.

## Authoring rules

### 1. Prefer one `defineAgent(...)` file

Default to one `agent.ts` per persona, exporting one `defineAgent({...})` with internal branching:

- `if (event.type === 'cron.tick') ...`
- `if (event.type === 'github.pull_request.opened') ...`

Do not split into many handlers unless the behavior is truly large.

### 2. Keep wakeups declarative in `defineAgent(...)`, behavior imperative in the handler

Use `defineAgent(...)` to declare **what can wake the agent**.
Do not try to encode the workflow in `persona.json`.
The actual routing and business logic belong in `agent.ts`.

### 3. Only declare integrations the agent actually requires — with a `scope`

If `agent.ts` never uses Slack behavior or Slack-backed writes, do not declare Slack in `persona.json` just because it might be useful later.

And for the integrations you *do* declare, **also declare a mount `scope`**. The
persona-kit type is
`PersonaIntegrationConfig { source?: IntegrationSource; scope?: Record<string, string>; config?: Record<string, unknown>; optional?: boolean; enabledByInput?: string }`,
where `scope` maps a resource name to an absolute relayfile glob, `config`
passes provider-owned adapter settings through unchanged, and `optional` /
`enabledByInput` gate the integration on a deploy input (see §3b). An **unscoped
provider mirror is dropped** — `slack: {}` (and `scope: {}`) mounts no provider
data, so reads come back empty and writes land on unmounted disk as silent
no-ops. Prefer the concrete subpaths the handler actually reads and writes back
to (least privilege — the relayfile token's path scope derives from the mount);
a broad `/provider/**` is valid but mounts the whole provider, and a mid-path
`*` mounts nothing (see §1):

```ts
integrations: {
  // Replies in-thread (writeback to /slack/channels/{id}/messages), so scope channels.
  slack: { scope: { channels: '/slack/channels/**' } },
  // Read-only Linear context — scope the concrete subpaths the handler reads.
  linear: { scope: { projects: '/linear/projects/**', issues: '/linear/issues/**' } }
}
```

The full mechanics and the labelled-mirror sub-trap are in the
production-correctness checklist below (§1).

### 3b. Gate conditional integrations with `optional` + `enabledByInput`

By default every declared integration is connected at deploy: its provider
credential is required and its triggers register. That is wrong for an
integration only *some* deploys use — declaring it unconditionally forces every
deployer to connect a provider they may not want.

`optional: true` + `enabledByInput: '<INPUT>'` (persona-kit ≥ 4.1.12,
workforce#252) make an integration **opt-in**: its provider connection, trigger
registration, and mount happen ONLY when the named input resolves to a non-empty
value (resolution order: `--input` flag > env var > input default). When the
input is empty the whole integration is pruned before connection. `optional: true`
**requires** `enabledByInput` (the parser rejects one without the other).

The canonical use is a **dual-transport agent** — one agent that declares both
`slack` and `telegram` and lets configuration pick which one(s) run, so a
Slack-only deploy never has to wire up a Telegram bot, and vice versa:

```ts
integrations: {
  slack: {
    optional: true,
    enabledByInput: 'SLACK_CHANNEL',          // set SLACK_CHANNEL → Slack connects
    scope: { channels: '/slack/channels/**' }
  },
  telegram: {
    optional: true,
    enabledByInput: 'TELEGRAM_CHAT',          // set TELEGRAM_CHAT → Telegram connects
    scope: { chats: '/telegram/chats/**', layout: '/telegram/LAYOUT.md' }
  }
},
inputs: {
  SLACK_CHANNEL: { env: 'SLACK_CHANNEL', optional: true, picker: { provider: 'slack', resource: 'channels' } },
  TELEGRAM_CHAT: { env: 'TELEGRAM_CHAT', optional: true }
}
```

The handler then registers both triggers (`slack: [...]`, `telegram: [...]`),
dispatches by `event.type` (`slack.*` vs `telegram.*`), and replies on the
**origin transport** so a message asked in one channel isn't mirrored to the
other. The unconfigured transport's trigger never fires because it was pruned.

Authoring rules:

- **Gate-on-id semantics:** the gating input typically doubles as the
  channel/chat/user id, so providing it both *enables* and *restricts* that
  transport. Decide deliberately — if you need "enabled but unrestricted", gate
  on a separate dedicated input instead of the id.
- Keep always-on data sources (e.g. a `google-mail` read mount) **non-optional** —
  only gate the transports/integrations a deploy can legitimately skip.
- Require persona-kit ≥ 4.1.12 in the agents repo. Older versions silently drop
  `optional`/`enabledByInput` (the integration would connect unconditionally),
  so verify the compiled `persona.json` actually carries the fields before
  deploy.

### 4. Use `integrations.<provider>.config` for adapter behavior, not mount behavior

`integrations.<provider>.config` is a forward-compatible adapter passthrough.
Persona-kit validates only that it is a plain object and preserves it for the
cloud adapter. It does **not** mount files, grant writeback path scope, or wake
the handler. Keep using `scope` and `defineAgent(...)` triggers for those.

Use `config` only for adapter settings that the provider explicitly documents.
It is not a portable cross-provider materialization API. The current production
case is **GitHub-only** materialization from `relayfile-adapters#193`: a persona
can keep GitHub lazy by default while eagerly materializing issues or pulls for
selected repositories.

```ts
integrations: {
  github: {
    scope: { paths: '/github/**' },
    config: {
      materialization: {
        default: 'lazy',
        webhookWritesForLazyRepos: true,
        rules: [
          {
            repos: ['AgentWorkforce/cloud'],
            issues: {
              mode: 'eager',
              filter: { state: 'open', labels: ['factory'] }
            },
            pulls: 'lazy'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Authoring rules:

- Use canonical GitHub materialization modes: `'lazy'` and `'eager'`. Adapter
  runtime aliases like `'all'` / `'none'` are not typed persona authoring
  values.
- Do not copy `config.materialization` to Slack, Linear, Notion, Jira, or other
  providers unless that adapter has shipped and documented the same setting.
  For unsupported providers, use `scope` plus handler-side filtering, or open an
  adapter follow-up instead of inventing persona config.
- Pair materialization with a concrete `scope` for any files the handler reads
  beyond the triggering subtree. `config.materialization` decides what the
  adapter syncs; `scope` decides what the persona mount can see.
- Keep `config` provider-owned. Do not put listener fields (`triggers`,
  `schedules`, `watch`) in it or under `integrations`; those belong in
  `defineAgent(...)`.
- Verify the compiled persona preserves both `integrations.<p>.scope` and
  `integrations.<p>.config` before deploy.

### 5. Schedules are named APIs

Declare schedules in `defineAgent({ schedules: [...] })`, not in `persona.json`.

Every schedule name should mean something operationally useful — it documents
the wakeup and (for multi-schedule personas) maps to the `event.schedule` cron
expression you match on. (v4: the handler does NOT receive `event.name`; see
"Event model (v4)" and G2.)

Good:

- `weekly`
- `daily-triage`
- `stale-pr-scan`

Bad:

- `job1`
- `schedule-a`

### 6. Memory should match the job

Examples:

- `workspace` scope for shared team/project context
- `user` scope for per-user assistant continuity
- `global` only when cross-workspace memory is truly intended

Do not enable memory by reflex if the persona is purely stateless.

### 7. `systemPrompt` should define the agent’s role, not the listener plumbing

The prompt should say what kind of agent this is and what quality bar it follows.
Do not stuff listener-routing details into the prompt when they are already in code.

## Good starter pattern

Use this shape unless there is a strong reason not to.

### persona.json

### agent.ts

```ts
import { defineAgent } from '@agentworkforce/runtime';

export default defineAgent({
  triggers: {
    github: [
      { on: 'pull_request.opened' },
      { on: 'issue_comment.created', match: '@mention' },
      { on: 'check_run.completed', where: 'conclusion=failure' }
    ],
    slack: [{ on: 'app_mention' }]
  },
  schedules: [{ name: 'daily-triage', cron: '0 9 * * 1-5', tz: 'UTC' }],
  handler: async (ctx, event) => {
    // event.type is provider-prefixed; payload is async (see "Event model (v4)").
    if (event.type === 'github.pull_request.opened') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;
      return; // review flow
    }
    if (event.type === 'github.issue_comment.created') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;
      return; // mention reply flow
    }
    if (event.type === 'github.check_run.completed') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;
      return; // failed-CI reaction flow
    }
    if (event.type === 'slack.app_mention') {
      const data = (await event.expand('full')).data;
      return; // slack reply flow
    }
    if (event.type === 'cron.tick') {
      return; // scheduled flow (single schedule → no name gate)
    }
  }
});
```

## Event-shape guidance

Use the runtime’s current v4 event model (see "Event model (v4)"):

- cron events: `event.type === 'cron.tick'`, with `event.schedule` / `event.scheduledFor` (no `event.name`)
- provider events: `event.type === '<provider>.<on>'`; the payload is `(await event.expand('full')).data` (async), not `event.payload`

Do not invent custom event wrappers when `@agentworkforce/runtime` already provides them.

When reading provider payloads:

- treat the expanded `.data` as provider-normalized but still loosely typed
- write small local extractor helpers instead of spreading unsafe casts everywhere
- validate required identifiers early and fail clearly
- prefer `defineAgent({...})` + helper functions over giant inline `if` blocks

## Context usage guidance

The useful pieces on `ctx` are typically:

- `ctx.persona`
- `ctx.harness.run(...)`
- `ctx.llm.complete(...)`
- `ctx.memory.save(...)`
- `ctx.memory.recall(...)`
- `ctx.sandbox.*`
- `ctx.files.*`
- `ctx.schedule.*`
- `ctx.workflow.*`
- `ctx.relay.dm(to, text)` / `ctx.relay.post(channel, text)` — **agent-to-agent** messaging over the relay (DM a peer agent by registered name, or post to a relay channel). Returns `{ ok, messageId? }` and **never throws** (`{ ok: false }` on failure). Use it to answer a relay-inbox DM (`isRelaycastMessageEvent`) or hand off to a peer agent — not for user-facing provider posts (those go through `@relayfile/relay-helpers`).
- `ctx.trajectory.*` — auto-recorded decision trail (no-op unless `persona.memory.trajectories` is opted in); always safe to call.
- `ctx.log(...)`

Prefer direct typed runtime helpers over invoking external commands.

### Provider reads and writes — use `@relayfile/relay-helpers`

There are **no** `ctx.<provider>` clients. The ergonomic way to talk to a
provider is **`@relayfile/relay-helpers`** — opt-in factory clients whose paths
come from the adapter catalog (so they can't drift from the adapter). Add
`@relayfile/relay-helpers` to the persona's `package.json`, then:

```ts
import { linearClient, slackClient, githubClient } from '@relayfile/relay-helpers';

const linear = linearClient();                   // binds the mount root once (RELAYFILE_MOUNT_ROOT)
const issue = await linear.getIssue(issueId);    // read
await linear.comment(issueId, ':rocket: done');  // write

await githubClient().comment({ owner, repo, number }, 'LGTM');
await githubClient().mergePullRequest({ owner, repo, number, method: 'squash' });
await slackClient().post('#eng', 'shipped');
await slackClient().dm(userId, 'heads up');
```

A write is a draft file the Relayfile writeback worker turns into the real
provider call (with retry/durability) — handlers never hold a token or call a
provider REST API directly.

The catalog now exposes **36 provider clients** (31 generated + 5 bespoke —
`githubClient`, `linearClient`, `slackClient`, `redditClient`, `telegramClient`),
plus the `providerClient` / `relayClient` escape hatches. (The old "all-29" count
is stale; the number is catalog-driven and grows as adapters ship, enforced by an
in-sync test.) When a provider has no bespoke method for what you need, use the
generic resource access — `providerClient('notion').pages.write({ databaseId }, {...})`
— or `relayClient('linear').write('issues', {}, {...})` when you need the raw
writeback **receipt** (`{ path, receipt: { url, id, identifier } }` — the created
record's URL/id).

**Delivery status is explicit now — don't treat a returned handle as delivered.**
The github/linear **create** helpers return a discriminated `CreatedResult`:
`status: 'confirmed' | 'pending' | 'dropped'`, plus `path` (the draft handle,
always present), `id` (falls back to `path` until a provider receipt supplies a
real id), and `url` (empty string until confirmed — never a filesystem path).
Idempotency rules: on **`pending`**, do NOT throw or retry (a retry can duplicate
the provider-side effect); **`dropped`** requires positive evidence the draft
won't be handled; genuinely ambiguous failures (admission timeout) still throw.
Never promote `pending` → `dropped` yourself. Slack's `post`/`dm`/`reply` keep
the older shape — they return `{ ts }` (`ts: ''` when no receipt arrived, a
**silent** non-delivery — see §1/§9), not a `CreatedResult`.

**Multi-transport delivery — `@agentworkforce/delivery`.** For an agent that
fans one message out to whichever transports are configured (Slack and/or
Telegram), prefer the delivery helper over hand-rolling per-provider posts:
`createDelivery(ctx, undefined, ['slack', 'telegram'])` exposes `.targets`,
`.publish()`, and `.send(text, { replyTo, nonBlocking })`. **Thread by passing a
header's `DeliveryResult` as `replyTo`** (not a raw `thread_ts`). hn-monitor uses
this for its threaded digest; agents that still hand-roll (spotify-releases) call
`slackClient().dm()` + a shared `../shared/telegram.ts` helper. Either way, the
idempotency rule from the notes holds: once the header has posted, don't throw —
a retried handler re-posts a duplicate header.

**Preview-safety (composable-runtime closure).** Handlers run under a closure that
records every side effect: provider writes land as `previewed` actions,
`memory`/`files` writes replay, and — importantly — **undeclared outbound HTTP is
denied**. A raw `GET`/`HEAD` via `node:http`/`fetch` that isn't allow-listed in
`capabilities.httpRead` is rejected before it runs (POSTs always denied). If a
handler must read a live URL, declare it (see §5b `httpRead`); otherwise
prefer VFS/provider reads.

**Lower-level escape hatch.** For reads that are *not* catalog writeback
resources (e.g. a github PR's record JSON, a provider's `_index.json`), drop to
the generic VFS helpers from `@agentworkforce/runtime`
(`readJsonFile`/`listJsonFiles`/`writeJsonFile`/`draftFile`).

> **`writeJsonFile` now THROWS on non-success.** The runtime's `writeJsonFile`
> wrapper (re-exported from `@relayfile/adapter-core/vfs-client`) normalizes the

> **relay-helpers Slack client still returns `ts: ''` silently** (it uses its own
> transport, not this wrapper), so the §1 "make delivery loud" rule for Slack
> still stands.

**Never assume a record path — the mount self-describes its layout.** The
relayfile adapter publishes a guide per provider at `/<provider>/LAYOUT.md`
(e.g. `/github/LAYOUT.md`) and an `_index.json` at each level. Its first rule is
literally *"always run `ls` before constructing a path"*, because record
directory names are **not guessable**: a GitHub PR is
`pulls/<number>__<slug>/meta.json` (number + sanitized title slug), **not**
`pulls/<number>/meta.json`. Read `LAYOUT.md`, walk the `_index.json` files, and
`ls`/inspect a directory before reading from it:

```ts
import { readJsonFile, resolveMountRoot } from '@agentworkforce/runtime';
import { readdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import path from 'node:path';

const root = resolveMountRoot({});
// LAYOUT.md + _index.json are the source of truth — read them, don't hardcode.
const pullsDir = path.join(root, 'github', 'repos', owner, repo, 'pulls');
const entry = (await readdir(pullsDir)).find((d) => d.startsWith(`${prNumber}__`));
if (!entry) throw new Error(`PR #${prNumber} not found under ${pullsDir}`);
const meta = await readJsonFile(
  { relayfileMountRoot: root }, 'github', 'getPr',
  `/github/repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${entry}/meta.json`
);
```

> **Scope it in.** `LAYOUT.md` lives at `/github/LAYOUT.md` — a sibling of
> `repos/`, **not** under it. A scope like `/github/repos/<owner>/**` does NOT
> mount the guide; use `/github/**` (or otherwise include `/github/LAYOUT.md`)
> if the handler should read it.

When unsure of a resource or path, prefer the in-mount `LAYOUT.md` / `_index.json`
(runtime truth), then the catalog (`@relayfile/adapter-core/writeback-paths`) or
the adapter's `resources.ts` — never guess a filename.

## When to use `ctx.harness.run(...)`

Use the harness when the persona needs real judgment or synthesis, for example:

- PR review comments
- replies to mentions
- code-fix suggestions
- summarization
- clustering and writing human-facing output

Do not use the harness for simple deterministic routing, field extraction, or formatting that plain TypeScript can do more safely.

**`[[NO_REPLY]]` — the supported silent-reply marker.** When a conversational
harness prompt decides there's nothing worth saying, have it emit the reserved
`[[NO_REPLY]]` marker. The runtime **strips the marker** before returning
`output` and sets `result.suppressed = true` (with `result.containsMarker`); a
`suppressed` result on `exitCode 0` is an intentional silent success, **not** a
failure — branch on it to skip the reply rather than posting an empty message.
`HarnessRunResult` also now carries `stderr` (folded into `output` on a non-zero
exit, so failure reasons are visible to callers that only read `output`).

## Inputs and env

Use `inputs` when the value is a declared runtime parameter for the persona, like:

- target repo
- topic list
- destination channel
- project code

Use `env` only for environment variables the harness process needs.
Do not put secrets into `inputs`.

## Common patterns

### Scheduled digest

Use when the agent runs on a cron schedule and writes a summary somewhere.

Persona:

- `cloud: true`
- integration connection declarations like `github` or `slack`
- optional `inputs` for topics/repos/channels

Agent:

- `defineAgent({ schedules: [...] })`
- branch on `event.type === 'cron.tick'` (multi-schedule: match `event.schedule`)
- fetch/search/gather
- summarize
- post or upsert
- save memory if the artifact matters later

### Integration-triggered reviewer

Use when the agent wakes on GitHub, Linear, Slack, etc.

Persona:

- `integrations.<provider>` for connection requirements
- `useSubscription: true` if the judgment should run on the user’s linked provider path
- often `memory.workspace`

Agent:

- `defineAgent({ triggers: { <provider>: [...] } })`
- branch on `event.type` (`'<provider>.<on>'`, or `.startsWith('<provider>.')`)
- extract target identifiers from `(await event.expand('full')).data`
- optionally load prior memory
- call harness for judgment/output
- write back with `@relayfile/relay-helpers`; use `writeJsonFile(...)` only
  for lower-level VFS/resource cases that the helper catalog does not cover

### Mixed schedule + integrations agent

Fine to combine both in one cloud agent when the role is coherent.
Examples:

- responds to Slack mentions and also runs a daily cleanup
- reacts to GitHub events and runs a weekly scan

Do not combine unrelated jobs into one agent just because the runtime allows it.

### Team member agent

Use when the persona is launched by a team dispatcher, not directly by provider
events.

Persona:

- `cloud: true`
- usually declares integrations needed by the member's sandbox/work
- harness/model/systemPrompt/harnessSettings describe the member role
- `onEvent: "./agent.ts"`

Agent:

- `defineAgent({ launchedBy: 'team-dispatcher', handler })`
- no `triggers`, `schedules`, or `watch`
- handler should usually log and return if invoked directly
- do not subscribe team members to the same provider events as the lead, or the
  lead and every member can fire for the same issue/PR

## Production correctness checklist

These rules came from shipped Workforce/agents defects. Apply them after the basic persona shape is in place and before deploy.

## 1. THE INTEGRATION SCOPE TRAP — declared ≠ mounted

**A persona integration without a `scope` mounts nothing.** Cloud derives the
relayfile mount paths (and the relayfile token's path scope) from exactly two
sources: the agent's **triggers** and each integration's **scope**
(`cloud → packages/web/lib/proactive-runtime/persona-deploy.ts`,
`relayfilePathsFromScope`). A bare declaration like:

```ts
integrations: {
  github: {},
  slack: {}     // ← INERT: no trigger, no scope → zero /slack paths mounted
}
```

means `slackClient().post(...)` writes its draft JSON to **unmounted local
disk**, polls ~3s for a writeback receipt that can never arrive, and returns
`{channel, ts: ''}` **without throwing** (adapter-core `vfs-client`
`writeJsonFile` → `waitForReceipt` returns `undefined` on timeout). The
notification is a perfectly silent no-op — this shipped as the pr-reviewer
Slack bug (agents#40).

The same `ts: ''` signature also appears when the scope **is** set but the
mount's read-side mirror never finished bootstrapping (e.g. a file/dir path
collision aborts every sync cycle), so the writeback can't be acknowledged — and
that one additionally marks the whole cloud run FAILED on the teardown flush. If
you see `ts: ''`, rule out a stuck mirror, not just a missing scope (see
[`setting-up-relayfile` → "cloud run marked FAILED but the handler logged
`runner.handler.ok`"](../setting-up-relayfile/SKILL.md#symptom-cloud-run-marked-failed-but-the-handler-logged-runnerhandlerok)).

Why github "just works" in most personas while slack doesn't: github usually
appears in `triggers`, and trigger paths are mounted independently of scope.
Any integration the handler only **writes** through (slack notifications,
linear comments on non-trigger issues) has no trigger to save it.

**The labelled-mirror sub-trap — a trigger that LOOKS like it covers the write
but doesn't.** A trigger mounts the watched subtree as a *read* mirror, and for
some providers the mirror path is **display-labelled** while the writeback path
is **canonical bare-id**. Slack is the production case: the trigger mirrors the
channel at `/slack/channels/{id}__{name}/messages` (channel id + `__` + name),
but `slackClient().post()` writes to `/slack/channels/{id}/messages` (bare id).
The two **never coincide**, so a Slack trigger does NOT cover a Slack write —
the draft still lands on unmounted disk and the post is a silent no-op even
though the run logs `handler.ok`. This shipped as the **linear-slack bug
(2026-06)**: the agent had a `slack` trigger on its board channel and *still*
posted into the void; the orphaned draft was recovered from the live sandbox.
github/linear are immune because their trigger and writeback paths share one
bare identifier form (`/github/repos/{owner}/{repo}/...`,
`/linear/issues/{issueId}/...`).

Rules:

- Every integration the handler writes through needs a trigger **or** a
  non-empty `scope` — **except Slack (and any display-labelled mirror): a Slack
  WRITE always needs a `scope`; a trigger is never enough.** Safest default:
  give every write-through integration an explicit `scope`.
- **Make delivery loud.** `post()`/`reply()`/`dm()` resolve with `ts: ''`
  instead of throwing when the writeback gets no receipt (the `ts: ''` signature
  above), so a dropped post still logs `handler.ok`. Treat an empty `ts` as
  failure (`if (!result.ts) throw …`) so the runtime surfaces `handler.error`
  instead of a silent no-op.
- **`scope: {}` does NOT work.** persona-kit's `parseIntegrationConfig`
  discards empty scope objects client-side before upload, so cloud's
  `/<provider>/**` provider-root fallback is unreachable from a persona.
- Scope values must be **strings** (persona-kit `parseStringMap` throws on
  arrays). A value starting with `/` is used verbatim as a mount glob; a bare
  value `v` under key `k` becomes `/<provider>/<k>/<v>/**`.
- When the target is picked at deploy time (e.g. a `SLACK_CHANNEL` input),
  scope the subtree, not the instance:

```ts
slack: {
  scope: { paths: '/slack/channels/**' }   // covers any picked channel, excludes DMs/users
}
```

- **A scope root must be a concrete prefix — a mid-path `*` mounts NOTHING.**
  Cloud reduces each scope to a remote root via `scopedRemoteRoot`
  (`cloud/packages/core/src/relayfile/mount-script.ts`): it strips a trailing
  `/**`, then **discards the path entirely if any `*` remains** (and
  `relayfile-mount --remote-path` only accepts a concrete prefix, never a glob).
  So a `*` is allowed *only* in the final `/**`:

  ```ts
  // ❌ silently dropped — the mid-path `*` survives the /** strip → mounts nothing
  github: { scope: { paths: '/github/repos/AgentWorkforce/*/pulls/**' } }
  // ✅ concrete root — mounts; filter to the repos/PRs you want in the handler
  github: { scope: { paths: '/github/**' } }
  ```

  This is doubly silent: the deploy still mints a matching fs token and the path
  passes string validation, so nothing errors — the handler just reads an empty
  tree. It bit daily-ship (every digest said "No PRs merged"). Pick the broadest
  concrete root and narrow in code. (Platform hardening tracked in
  `AgentWorkforce/cloud#1986`.)

- **Verify after compiling**: run `agentworkforce persona compile <dir>/persona.ts`
  and check the generated persona.json still carries `integrations.<p>.scope`
  and any `integrations.<p>.config` adapter settings. If persona-kit dropped the
  field, the deployed persona is silently inert or falls back to adapter defaults.
- Pin a test (see §6): parse `persona.integrations` through persona-kit's
  `parseIntegrations` and assert the scope survives as a non-empty map covering
  the writeback subtree your client uses; assert adapter `config` survives when
  a GitHub persona depends on materialization or a provider documents another
  provider-owned setting.

## 2. `sandbox: true` vs `sandbox: false`

`sandbox` is a top-level boolean on the persona spec
(persona-kit `parse.js` `parseSandbox`; default **true** when omitted).

| | `sandbox: true` (default) | `sandbox: false` |
|---|---|---|
| Daytona box | provisioned per fire (seconds of cold start) | **none** — handler runs in the persona runner (ms) |
| `ctx.sandbox.exec()` | available | **rejects** (`SandboxNotAvailableError`) |
| `ctx.files.read/write` | available | unavailable |
| Relayfile **filesystem mount** (`resolveMountRoot` + `readJsonFile`/`readdir` against the mount path) | mirrored by the mount daemon | **NOT mounted** — the daemon is skipped, so mount-path reads come back **empty**. Reads must go over the relayfile **HTTP API** (relay-helpers clients / API-mode reads), not the filesystem. |
| `ctx.harness.run()` | available | **unusable** — harness CLI credentials are NOT mounted (`EMPTY_HARNESS_CLI_CREDENTIAL_MOUNT`) and no `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`/`CODEX_OAUTH_CREDENTIAL` env is set, so the claude/codex/opencode CLI cannot authenticate. The method exists but a real harness run fails (`deployment-trigger-delivery.ts`). |
| Harness CLI credentials | mounted | not mounted |
| `ctx.llm.complete()` | available | available **only with an explicit credential** — set `useSubscription: true` (or a credentialSelection) so the credential rides in `providerEnv`; the harness-mount fallback that normally backs `ctx.llm` is gone under `sandbox: false` |
| PR-reviewer checkout / PR writeback / conflict-autofix / git workspace clone | available when capabilities declared | **disabled even if declared** (cloud gates them on `!lightweightSandbox`, `deployment-trigger-delivery.ts`) |

Pick `sandbox: false` **only** for read-classify-reply personas that answer via
`ctx.llm.complete()` (set `useSubscription: true` or a credentialSelection so the
credential survives in `providerEnv`) and whose provider I/O rides the relayfile
**HTTP API** — i.e. **writes** through `@relayfile/relay-helpers` clients
(`slackClient().post()` etc.). joke-bot is the model: a zero-data-dependency
conversational bot that only writes.

> **`sandbox: false` gets no filesystem mount.** If the handler **reads
> materialized provider data from the mount** (`resolveMountRoot()` +
> `readJsonFile`/`readdir`, e.g. `/google-mail/threads/**`), those reads come back
> **empty** under `sandbox: false` — the mount daemon is skipped. inbox-buddy is
> the cautionary case: it reads Gmail from the VFS mount, so it **must** be
> `sandbox: true` even though it uses no harness. Rule of thumb: **write-only →
> `sandbox: false` is fine; read-from-mount → needs `sandbox: true`** (or restructure
> reads to go over the relayfile HTTP API).

Any persona that calls
`ctx.harness.run()` — i.e. a claude/codex/opencode conversational or coding agent —
**must keep `sandbox: true`**: the harness needs the box and its mounted CLI
credentials (`sandbox: false` drops them, so the run fails). Also keep the default
for anything that clones repos, runs shells, or uses PR capabilities.

> **Wake cost (sandbox-per-message trap).** A channel-wide trigger like
> `slack: [{ on: 'message.created', paths: ['/slack/channels/${SLACK_CHANNEL}/**'] }]`
> wakes — and on `sandbox: true` **provisions a Daytona box + runs the harness** —
> for **every** message in the channel, even ones the handler self-filters and
> drops. The handler's own skip-guards run AFTER provisioning, so they don't save
> the box. Gate the wake at the trigger so the box is only provisioned when the
> agent is actually addressed: add **`match: '@mention'`** (fires only when the
> message contains a Slack mention token) or **`where: 'field=value'`** (exact
> payload-field condition). A pure reply bot can instead use `ctx.llm.complete` +
> `sandbox: false` and skip the box entirely.

## 3. Inputs — declaration and resolution

Declare inputs in the persona spec:

```ts
inputs: {
  SLACK_CHANNEL: {
    description: 'Channel for review pings.',
    env: 'SLACK_CHANNEL',
    optional: true,                                  // no default → unset means feature off
    picker: { provider: 'slack', resource: 'channels' } // deploy-UI picker; stores channel ID
  }
}
```

Resolution facts (verified against cloud delivery + runtime):

- Cloud does **not** export each input as a bare env var in the sandbox.
  Input values travel inside `WORKFORCE_AGENT_CONTEXT` (JSON) and surface as
  `ctx.persona.inputs` (the runtime merges the `inputValues` / `input_values`
  aliases).
- The conventional handler accessor checks env first (local dev), then ctx:

```ts
function input(ctx: WorkforceCtx, name: string): string | undefined {
  const spec = ctx.persona?.inputSpecs?.[name];
  const v = process.env[spec?.env ?? name] ?? ctx.persona?.inputs?.[name] ?? spec?.default;
  return typeof v === 'string' && v.trim() ? v : undefined;
}
```

- An **optional input with no default that gates a feature** means the feature
  is off-by-config when undeployed — fine, but document it, and remember it
  compounds with §1: the feature needs the input set **and** the path mounted.
- Picker types observed in production: `{provider:'slack', resource:'channels'}`,
  `{provider:'github', resource:'users'}`. Pickers store provider IDs
  (e.g. `C…` channel IDs), not display names.

## 4. Harness and model selection

- `harness`: which CLI runs `ctx.harness.run()` prompts — `'codex'` or
  `'claude'`. `model` must match the harness family (e.g. `gpt-5.x` for codex;
  `claude-*` for claude).
- `harnessSettings`: `reasoning`, `timeoutSeconds`, `sandboxMode`,
  `workspaceWriteNetworkAccess`, and
  `dangerouslyBypassApprovalsAndSandbox: true` — required for codex in cloud
  fires because **Daytona is the trust boundary** and codex's nested bubblewrap
  sandbox needs user namespaces Daytona doesn't allow. Say so in a comment when
  you set it.
- Version pinning: capabilities, `integrations.<provider>.config`, and other
  spec fields are parsed **client-side by persona-kit before upload**. A
  persona-kit older than the field you're using silently strips it (this shipped
  as the teamSolve-capability strip). Exact-pin `@agentworkforce/persona-kit`
  (and cli/runtime) in the repo and verify the compiled artifact carries every
  field you depend on.

## 5. Teams — `teamSolve` capability and `team.json`

A lead persona opts into team orchestration via capabilities
(`cloud → packages/core/src/proactive-runtime/capabilities.ts`):

```json
"capabilities": {
  "teamSolve": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxMembers": 1,          // default 4, hard-capped at 4
    "roles": ["implementer"], // default ["lead","impl","reviewer","prober"]
    "tokenBudget": 400000,    // default 400000
    "timeBudgetSeconds": 1800 // default 1800
  }
}
```

Multi-member rosters bind through `team.json`
(`cloud → packages/core/src/proactive-runtime/team-spec.ts`, loaded from the
persona directory; bound via `PUT /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/teams`):

```json
{
  "id": "my-team",                      // must match the team directory name
  "lead": "alice",                      // must reference a member name
  "members": [
    { "name": "alice", "persona": "alice-persona-slug", "role": "lead" },
    { "name": "bob",
      "persona": { "slug": "bob-persona-slug", "version": 2 },
      "role": "implementer",
      "owns": [ { "issue.labels": ["bug"] } ] }
  ],
  "tokenBudget": 1000000,
  "timeBudgetSeconds": 3600
}
```

Validation: unique member names and persona refs, no duplicate `owns`
ownership, `inline` persona refs rejected (Phase 1). Members resolve to
already-deployed personas in the workspace — deploy members first, then bind.
Spawning is cloud-side (`launchMember`); there is **no in-box
`ctx.team.spawn`** — don't write handler code that assumes one.

## 5b. Other persona `capabilities`

Beyond `teamSolve`, the persona spec now carries several capability blocks. Like
all capabilities they're parsed **client-side by persona-kit** — pin a recent
persona-kit and verify the compiled artifact carries them (§4).

- **`httpRead` — live outbound-read allowlist.** Handlers run under a
  preview-safe closure that **denies undeclared outbound HTTP** (see "Preview
  safety" in the reads/writes section). To let a handler read a live URL,
  allow-list it:

  ```json
  "capabilities": {
    "httpRead": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allow": [
        { "method": "GET",  "urlGlob": "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/**" },
        { "method": "HEAD", "urlGlob": "https://example.com/status" }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  Only `GET`/`HEAD` are expressible (`method` + `urlGlob` both required); POSTs
  are always denied. Prefer VFS/provider reads; reach for `httpRead` only for a
  genuine external API the catalog doesn't mirror. See
  `references/agents/hn-monitor/persona.json` (compiled) for a live example — it
  allow-lists the Hacker News Algolia API (`https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/...`).

- **`conversational` — cloud chat routing.** Opts a persona into cloud's
  `app_mention`/chat responder routing (used by joke-bot):
  `{ enabled, defaultResponder, channels, identity }`. Pair it with the transport
  triggers/handler branches the persona actually implements.

- **`conflictResolve` — PR conflict autofix directive** (review agent):
  `{ directive: '@relay fix conflicts', resolveMarkers: true }` — declares the
  comment directive and marker-resolution behavior the reviewer honors. Requires
  `sandbox: true` (it clones/edits — gated on `!lightweightSandbox`, §2).

## 6. The showcase quality bar (AgentWorkforce/agents repo)

The agents repo is a public showcase. Merges get blocked on brittleness even
when the code works and is approved. The bar:

- **No inline base64 blobs, no `node -e` one-liners, no hand-rolled shell
  quoting** inside handlers or workflows. Extract checked-in helper scripts.
- **Pass data as JSON arguments** (a JSON file or single JSON env/arg), never
  as positional shell argv that needs quoting.
- **Golden tests are a merge gate.** Exported pure helpers (`readPr`,
  `labelNames`, allowlist deciders) get node:test coverage in `tests/`; persona
  config invariants (like §1's scope) get pinned with a test proven **red**
  against the broken shape before the fix lands.
- persona.json is **generated** from persona.ts in the agents repo (untracked
  since agents#24) — edit persona.ts, never the artifact.

## 7. `onEvent` handler patterns

Declare wakeups in `defineAgent({...})` (triggers / schedules / watch);
branch imperatively in the handler. Hard-won guard patterns:

- **First line** (single-provider personas): `if (!event.type.startsWith('<provider>.')) return;` — multi-provider handlers branch per `event.type` prefix instead of returning early. (v4: there is no `event.source`.)
- **Terminal-event guards before work**: approval → merge → return;
  green check_run → return; only then the expensive review path.
- **Read materialized meta defensively.** Provider projections drift — accept
  both shapes when one has shipped (`author?: string | { login?: string }`),
  and decide explicitly whether a gate **fails open or closed** when meta is
  missing (author allowlist: fail closed; skip-label check on a payload that
  lacks labels: fail open). Comment the choice.
- **Cron**: branch on `event.type === 'cron.tick'`. The v4 cron event has **no
  `event.name`** — only `event.schedule` (the cron expr / one-shot id) and
  `event.scheduledFor`. For a single-schedule persona, treat any `cron.tick` as
  that schedule; do NOT gate on a schedule name (it isn't delivered, so the gate
  becomes a permanent silent no-op). For a multi-schedule persona, discriminate
  by matching `event.schedule` against the cron expressions you declared.
- **Sentinel contracts with the harness**: if the handler keys behavior off
  harness output (e.g. a literal `READY` last line), spell the contract out in
  the prompt and parse only the last line — and remember output-tail
  truncation preserves the end, not the start.
- Log skips with reasons (`ctx.log?.('info', 'skipped', { reason })`) — a
  silent return is indistinguishable from a delivery failure during triage.

## 8. Delegation — `ctx.workflow.run` vs `ctx.harness.run`

Two ways to do heavy work; pick by shape:

| | `ctx.harness.run(args)` | `ctx.workflow.run(name, args)` |
|---|---|---|
| What | one prompt through the persona's harness CLI | a multi-step agent-relay workflow (DAG of deterministic + agent steps) |
| Returns | `{ output, exitCode, durationMs }` directly | `{ runId, completion() }`; `await completion()` → `{ output, status }` |
| Use for | single coding/review task in the box | clone → implement → open-PR pipelines, multi-agent coordination |

The **thin-lead pattern** (linear chat lead,
`references/agents/linear/agent.ts`):
classify intent with a cheap harness/LLM call → **reply to the user
immediately** ("starting an implementation workflow…") → delegate via
`ctx.workflow.run` → on completion, post the result (e.g. extract the PR URL
from `completion.output`). The chat handler stays responsive; the workflow
carries the long work. Keep workflow definitions as checked-in files under
`workflows/` (see §6) rather than assembling source strings in the handler.

That agent also shows the **Linear Agent Session API** via `linearClient()`:
triggers `on: 'AgentSessionEvent.created' | 'AgentSessionEvent.prompted' |
'AppUserNotification.issueCommentMention'` (delivered provider-prefixed, e.g.
`event.type === 'linear.AgentSessionEvent.created'`), and the handler streams
progress with `linearClient().agentActivity(sessionId, { type: 'thought' |
'response' | 'elicitation' | 'action' | 'error', body })`, `respond(sessionId,
body)`, and `acknowledge(sessionId)`. Key session-scoped memory on the
`sessionId`.

## 9. Relayfile — how provider clients actually resolve

`slackClient()` / `linearClient()` / `githubClient()` / `providerClient(p)`
from `@relayfile/relay-helpers` are **not** HTTP clients. A `write` resolves a
catalog path (`/slack/channels/{channelId}/messages`), drops a uniquely-named
draft JSON under the **mount root**, and waits for the writeback worker to
replace it with a receipt. Reads (`readJsonFile`, `.list()`) read materialized
JSON from the same tree.

Consequences:

- **The path must be mounted** (token-scoped + daemon-watched) or the draft
  sits on local disk forever and the call returns silently — see §1.
- **Anchor the mount root explicitly.** The runner's CWD is not the mount
  root (CWD `…/workforce-runtime` vs mount `…/workspace` shipped as a real
  ENOENT bug). Pass `{ relayfileMountRoot: resolveMountRoot({}) }` or rely on
  the `RELAYFILE_MOUNT_ROOT` env — never on relative paths from CWD.
- **A returned receipt / `confirmed` status is the success signal.**
  `result.receipt?.created/id` present (or a `CreatedResult.status === 'confirmed'`)
  → delivered; absent/`pending` after the wait → not yet delivered. Two write
  surfaces now behave differently: the **relay-helpers clients** (`slackClient`,
  `githubClient`, `linearClient`) do **not** throw on a missing receipt — Slack
  returns `ts: ''` and github/linear return a `pending`/`dropped` `CreatedResult`
  — so you must inspect the return; the lower-level **runtime `writeJsonFile`**
  now **throws `WritebackError`** on non-success instead. Either way, if delivery
  is load-bearing, check the result and surface the failure. Do **not** retry a
  `pending` create (duplicate-effect risk — see the idempotency rules above).
- Item paths (ending `.json`) are direct read/write; collection paths take
  drafts and `.list()`. Encode user-supplied path segments with
  `encodeSegment(...)`.
- Terminal provider states (closed/merged/archived) stay readable as records
  with terminal status — never model them as deletions.

## Production pre-merge checklist

1. Every written-to integration has a trigger or a non-empty, string-valued
   scope (§1) — and the **compiled** persona.json still carries it.
2. `sandbox` matches the capability set (§2) — no `ctx.sandbox.exec` /
   PR-capability reliance under `sandbox: false`.
3. Feature-gating inputs documented; resolution goes through a `input(ctx, …)`
   helper, not bare `process.env` (§3).
4. Harness/model pair valid; persona-kit/cli/runtime pinned; compiled artifact
   carries every capability you declared (§4, §5).
5. Tests pin the config invariants and were proven red against the broken
   shape (§6).
6. Handler guards: `event.type` prefix check first, terminal events
   early-returned, defensive meta reads with explicit fail-open/closed choices,
   no schedule-name gate on `cron.tick` (there is no `event.name` — §7, G2).
7. Writeback receipts checked where delivery matters (§9).


## Field gotchas (verified against workforce 4.1.34; agents repo pins runtime/persona-kit/cli 4.1.23)

These each cost a compile/deploy failure in practice; check them before deploy.

- **G1 — `intent` must be a `PERSONA_INTENTS` value.** `persona compile` rejects
  anything else: `persona compile: intent "planning" is invalid`. The shipped set
  includes `relay-orchestrator`, `requirements-analysis`, `architecture-plan`,
  `review`, `documentation`, `verification`, … (see persona-kit `constants.ts`
  `PERSONA_INTENTS`). Note `planning` is a valid **tag**, not an intent — don't
  confuse the two. `tags` is open-ish; `intent` is a closed enum.
- **G2 — cron has no schedule name.** See "Event model (v4)": branch on
  `event.type === 'cron.tick'`; the only schedule fields are `event.schedule`
  (cron expr) and `event.scheduledFor`. Single-schedule personas just run their
  one behavior on `cron.tick`.
- **G3 — an input can't set both `optional: true` and `default`.** `persona
  compile` errors: `cannot set both 'optional: true' and 'default' — pick one`.
  A `default` already makes the input always-resolved; use `default` alone for a
  fallback, or `optional: true` alone for a may-be-empty feature gate.
- **G4 — `agentworkforce deploy` takes a persona FILE path, not a directory**
  (a dir → `EISDIR`). It now accepts the authored **`persona.ts`** source
  directly (compiled in place) as well as a compiled `persona.json`. See the
  deploy runbook.
- **G5 — memory is append-only.** `ctx.memory` has only `save` (with `tags`,
  `scope`, `ttlSeconds` / `expiresInMs`) and `recall` (by relevance + `limit`).
  There is **no delete or upsert**, and `recall` ranks by **relevance, not
  recency**. Consequences for "tight"/"current" memory:
  - to read *the latest* of a tag, recall a handful and pick `max(createdAt)` —
    a naive `limit:1` can return a stale-but-relevant item;
  - keep one **single author** per logical record (e.g. one "brief" writer) so
    copies don't compete;
  - **carry-forward**: re-synthesize the durable record from (previous record +
    recent notes) so it survives raw-note TTL expiry;
  - set short per-write TTLs (`ttlSeconds`) on the handler `save`; the persona's
    `memory.ttlDays` is only a backstop default;
  - to "garden" a noisy tag, write a consolidated/deduped note and let the
    originals lapse via TTL — you can't delete them.
- **G6 — `teamSolve` fan-out is all-or-nothing on the lead's fire.** The cloud
  dispatcher launches the **whole** roster when the lead triggers, and the
  capability is wired to the GitHub-issue launch path — so it can't give roster
  members independent cadences (e.g. a nightly member + an hourly member). When
  teammates need different clocks, prefer an **independent collective**:
  separately-deployed agents that each own their trigger/schedule and cooperate
  through shared **workspace** memory tags, rather than a `team.json` roster.

## Anti-patterns

Avoid these:

- writing old `tiers`-based personas when the repo uses flat runtime fields
- putting business logic into `persona.json`
- declaring integrations that `agent.ts` never uses
- declaring `defineAgent(...).triggers`, `schedules`, or `watch` without implementing branches for them
- using `systemPrompt` as a substitute for explicit code routing
- giant unstructured handlers with no helper functions
- reaching for `ctx.github` / `ctx.linear` / etc. — those per-provider clients no longer exist; use `@relayfile/relay-helpers` (or the runtime VFS helpers)
- hardcoding `/<provider>/...` mount paths in the handler when a `@relayfile/relay-helpers` client already resolves them from the catalog
- invoking external commands (`curl`, `gh`, provider SDKs) for provider reads/writes that relay-helpers / the VFS helpers already cover via Relayfile draft writes
- assuming all provider payload fields exist without validation

## Deploying: lead the human from local login to a live cloud agent

Authoring isn't finished at the files — **drive the deploy end to end** with the
`agentworkforce` CLI. Run every non-interactive step yourself, hand the human
only the steps that genuinely need a browser, and narrate what each command
printed so they always know the state.

**What you (the agent) can do vs. what the human must do**

- **Human-only (interactive browser):** `agentworkforce login` (OAuth sign-in)
  and the per-provider **connect** popups during deploy. You can't complete a
  browser OAuth flow — ask the human to run the command / finish the popup, then
  continue.
- **You run:** the dry-run, the deploy itself (once the human is logged in),
  `deployments list`, reading the printed deployment URL/status, and `destroy`.
  (If your environment can't run the CLI at all, hand the human the exact
  commands below in order and tell them what each should print.)

**Runbook**

1. **Check auth.** If a CLI call 401s, the human isn't logged in. Ask them to run
   `agentworkforce login` — it opens the browser to `https://agentrelay.com`, they
   pick a workspace, and it resolves the workspace descriptor
   (`GET /api/v1/workspaces/<ws>/resolve`) and stores a **workspace key** in the
   agent-relay cloud session store — then wait for them to confirm before
   continuing. `--workspace <id-or-slug>` skips the picker. (Login **no longer
   writes** a `~/.agentworkforce/active.json` pointer, so don't test for that file
   — a 401 is the reliable "not logged in" signal.)

2. **Dry-run — you run this.** Validate before any side effects:

   ```bash
   agentworkforce deploy ./path/to/persona/persona.ts --mode cloud --dry-run
   ```

   **Pass a FILE, not the directory** (a directory → `EISDIR`). Deploy now
   accepts the authored **`persona.ts`** source directly (it compiles it in
   place via `compileAgentSource`/`loadPersonaSourceFile`) — you no longer need a
   separate `agentworkforce persona compile` step first; a `persona.json` path
   still works too. A clean
   dry-run prints e.g. `persona <id>: N integration(s), M schedule(s)` then
   `ok: <id> (dry-run)` — eyeball those counts. Fix any preflight error (missing
   `onEvent`, wrong shape, an integration the `agent.ts` listens on but
   `persona.json` doesn't declare; an invalid `intent`) and re-run until clean.

3. **Deploy — you run this; the human completes any connect popups.**

   ```bash
   agentworkforce deploy ./path/to/persona/persona.ts --mode cloud --on-exists update
   ```

   - It compiles + bundles the persona spec + `agent.ts` and, for each provider in
     the persona's `integrations` that isn't connected yet, opens a connect flow —
     relay that to the human and wait for them to finish before continuing.
   - `--on-exists update` redeploys over an existing persona of the same id.
     **Gotcha:** the default is `cancel`, a silent no-op — if a deploy "did
     nothing", you wanted `--on-exists update`.
   - `--reconnect <provider>` forces a fresh connect — it now also covers the
     **harness LLM credential** (e.g. `--reconnect openai/codex`,
     `--reconnect anthropic/claude`), and is repeatable; `--no-connect` fails
     instead of prompting (use only when everything's already connected);
     `--input key=value` overrides a declared input; `--detach` backgrounds the runner.
   - `--harness-source <managed|byok|oauth>` selects how the harness LLM
     authenticates (`managed` = platform-managed credential, `byok` = your own
     API key, `oauth` = OAuth). **`plan` is a legacy alias for `managed`** — the
     old `--harness-source plan` still works but prefer `managed`.

4. **Confirm it's live — you run this.** Capture the deployment URL/status the
   deploy printed, then:

   ```bash
   agentworkforce deployments list       # what's running in the workspace
   ```

   Report back to the human: **the deployment link**, which triggers/schedules
   registered, and which integrations are connected. Tear down with
   `agentworkforce destroy ./path/to/persona` when needed.

Triggers/schedules/watch declared in `defineAgent(...)` register at deploy time,
so every integration the agent listens on must be connected — an unconnected
provider means its triggers never fire.

## Validation checklist

Before declaring the persona done:

1. `persona.json` matches the current schema shape used in examples
2. `cloud` personas include `onEvent`
3. `agent.ts` uses `defineAgent(...)` with either a listener source:
   - `triggers`, or
   - `schedules`, or
   - `watch`
   or an intentional team-member shape like `launchedBy: 'team-dispatcher'`
4. every declared trigger, schedule, or watch rule has a code path in `handler`
5. every provider named in `agent.ts` listener config is also declared in `persona.json.integrations`
6. `systemPrompt` describes the role clearly
7. harness/model/settings fit the job
8. memory config is intentional, not accidental
9. the handler uses `ctx.log(...)` or durable side effects clearly enough for debugging

## Output contract for this skill

When creating or editing a cloud persona, return:

1. the full `persona.json`
2. the full `agent.ts`
3. a short note explaining:
   - why the chosen listener declarations belong in `defineAgent(...)`
   - why the chosen deploy/runtime config belongs in `persona.json`
   - why the chosen behavior belongs in `agent.ts`
   - which current Workforce example the shape most closely follows
4. then **drive the deploy** per "Deploying" above — don't stop at the files.
   Run the dry-run and deploy yourself; ask the human to run `agentworkforce
   login` and to finish each integration-connect popup; and finish by reporting
   the live deployment link, the registered triggers/schedules, and the
   connected integrations.
