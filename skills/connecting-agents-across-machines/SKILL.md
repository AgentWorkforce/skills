# Connecting Agents Across Machines

Agent Relay coordinates agents through a **workspace**. Agents on different
machines that share the same workspace can use the same DMs, channels, threads
and inbox, no matter which machine they run on. Each machine runs its own
**node** (a local broker). The node connects to the workspace and hosts the
agents on that machine.

```
 Machine A                          Machine B
 ┌──────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────┐
 │ agent-relay node up  │           │ agent-relay node up  │
 │  ├─ Lead (claude)    │           │  ├─ Worker (codex)   │
 │  └─ Reviewer         │           │  └─ Tester           │
 └──────────┬───────────┘           └──────────┬───────────┘
            └──────── same workspace key ──────┘
                 (messages, channels, spawns)
```

You don't need a Relay Cloud sandbox for this. Your own machines are the
nodes.

Prefer setting this up with the Agent Relay agent at
<https://arelay.to/agent-relay>, which checks your current state and confirms
each step. Fetch its instructions with

Run every command from the **same project directory** on each machine.
`workspace create` / `join` pin the workspace to that directory
(`.agentworkforce/relay/workspace-key.json`), and `node up` reads that pin.

## Setup (once)

### 0. Check what each machine already has

Run these first on every machine. If `agent-relay --version` fails, install the
CLI first with `npm install -g agent-relay`. The checks only read state:

```bash
agent-relay cloud whoami       # signed in, and as whom
agent-relay workspace active   # the active Cloud workspace (keys stay masked)
agent-relay cloud workspaces   # every workspace this login can use, with ids
agent-relay status             # workspace, cloud login and local broker
agent-relay workspace list     # workspaces stored on this machine
```

If the human already has a shared workspace, skip step 1 and join it on each
machine that is not on it yet (step 2). Create a workspace only when the human
explicitly wants a new one.

### The workspace key never enters an agent session

Joining a machine to a workspace needs its key, and agent-relay 13.x has no
keyless join: Cloud sign-in and `cloud enroll` do not hand a workspace key to
the local broker. So the **human** moves the key, entirely outside any agent
transcript:

- The agent never runs `--reveal-secrets` (`workspace create`, `workspace key`,
  `workspace active --json`) and never runs `workspace join` with a real key.
- The agent never asks for the key in chat and never reads it from a file.
  If someone pastes a key into the conversation anyway, tell the human to treat
  it as leaked and to create a fresh workspace.
- The human reveals the key and enters it only in their own terminal, one no
  agent or recorder is watching, and moves it between machines over a secure
  channel such as a password manager.

### 1. Create the workspace on one machine

On **machine A** (the agent may run this; the key stays masked in the output
and is stored on this machine):

```bash
npm install -g agent-relay
agent-relay workspace create my-team
```

Then ask the human to copy the key **in their own terminal** on machine A, not
through the agent:

```bash
# Human only, in a terminal no agent is reading:
agent-relay workspace key my-team --reveal-secrets
```

They save it to a password manager (or another encrypted channel) for machine
B. Never put it in a chat, ticket, repo, or a message to an agent.

### 2. Join the same workspace on every other machine

On **machine B**, and on any further machines, the agent may install the CLI
(`npm install -g agent-relay`). The **human** then runs the join in their own
terminal, from the same project directory, pasting the key at the hidden
prompt:

```bash
# Human only, in a terminal no agent is reading:
read -r -s -p 'Workspace key: ' RELAY_KEY; printf '\n'   # not echoed or saved to history
agent-relay workspace join my-team "$RELAY_KEY"
unset RELAY_KEY
```

The agent confirms the result with read-only commands that never print the
key: `agent-relay workspace list` should show `my-team` as active, and
`agent-relay workspace active` its workspace IDs.

> **Do not skip this step.** If `node up` runs on a machine with no workspace
> configured, it can silently create a **new** workspace. Both nodes then look
> healthy but can't see each other. Run `join` first on every machine after
> the first.

### 3. Start a node on each machine

Give each machine a distinct, stable name. Use agent-relay 11.3.1 or later:
11.3.0 and earlier print the workspace key from `node up` and `node status`.

```bash
# machine A
agent-relay node up --background --broker-name laptop-a
# machine B
agent-relay node up --background --broker-name mini-b
```

Every AI CLI you want to run on a machine (`claude`, `codex`, …) must be
installed **and logged in on that machine**. Relay starts the CLI but can't
log in for it. An expired login shows up as an agent that starts and then
does nothing.

Stop a node with `agent-relay node down`, not by killing the process. A
killed node can leave its name reserved.

## Verify the link

From either machine:

```bash
agent-relay workspace list        # both machines should show the same active workspace
agent-relay fleet nodes           # both node names listed, status "online"
agent-relay fleet agent list      # agents across every reachable node
```

To prove messaging works end to end, put one agent on each machine and have
the remote one write to the local one. Run both commands from machine A:

```bash
agent-relay fleet spawn claude --node laptop-a --name Receiver --no-confirm \
  --task "Wait for a DM from Sender. Write its exact text to ./received.txt, reply 'got it', and stop."

agent-relay fleet spawn codex --node mini-b --name Sender --no-confirm \
  --task "Run 'hostname', then DM Receiver exactly: hello from <hostname output>. Wait for the reply and stop."
```

Within a couple of minutes, `received.txt` on machine A should contain
`hello from <machine B's hostname>`. Clean up:

```bash
agent-relay fleet release Sender
agent-relay fleet release Receiver
```

> **Confirm a spawn by checking the target machine, not by the CLI's exit
> code.** A targeted spawn can print `spawn_failed` or `spawn_unconfirmed`
> even though the agent launched fine. Before retrying, run
> `agent-relay node agent list` **on the target machine**. If the agent is
> there with `"ready": true`, it's running. A blind retry can start a
> duplicate. `--no-confirm` skips the wait and returns once the node accepts
> the spawn.

## Everyday use

**Spawn onto a specific machine**, for example when that machine has the repo,
GPU or credentials the job needs:

```bash
agent-relay fleet spawn codex --node mini-b --name Builder \
  --task "Run the test suite in the current directory and report failures to Lead" \
  --cwd /Users/me/code/app
```

`--cwd` is a path **on the target machine**. Write it as an absolute path.
Don't use `~`, because your local shell expands it to *your* home directory
before the command is sent. Each machine uses its own
checkout, and nothing is copied between machines.

**Let Relay pick a machine**: use `--auto-place` instead of `--node`.

**Release an agent**: `agent-relay fleet release <name>`.

**From inside an agent** (Relay MCP tools): agents message each other by name
with `send_dm` / `post_message` whichever machine they run on.
`spawn` takes a `target_node` to choose the machine.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Nodes are up but can't see each other's agents | The machines are on different workspaces, often because `node up` ran before `workspace join` | Run `agent-relay workspace list` on both machines. Have the human run the step 2 join on the odd machine out, in their own terminal, then `node down` and `node up` |
| `fleet nodes` doesn't list a machine | The node is on another workspace, or isn't running | Check `workspace list` and `node status` on that machine. `fleet nodes --all` also shows hidden or offline records |
| Spawn reports `spawn_failed` / `spawn_unconfirmed` | The launch confirmation didn't arrive, but the agent often did start | Run `agent-relay node agent list` on the target machine before retrying |
| Agent starts but never acts or replies | Its CLI isn't logged in on that machine (e.g. `401 OAuth access token has been revoked`) | Log in to that CLI on the target machine (`claude /login`, `codex login`), or spawn a different CLI |
| `message` CLI commands say `requires agentToken` | The `message` commands act as a registered agent | Test messaging agent to agent as shown above, or use the Relay MCP tools from inside an agent |
| `Invalid API key` | The CLI is using a different active workspace than you expect | Run `agent-relay workspace switch my-team` and retry |
| Node shows online but spawns never land on it | The node advertises no spawn capability for that CLI (e.g. only `claude`, not `codex`) | Install and log in to that CLI on the target machine, then restart the node |
| Agent spawned on B can't find files | `--cwd` points to a path that exists only on A | Use a path that exists on the target machine |
